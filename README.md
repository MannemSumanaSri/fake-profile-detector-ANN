# fake-profile-detector-ANN
This project aims to detect fake or bot user profiles on social media using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It uses user metadata and content-based features to classify profiles as real or fake.

🚀 Features
Detects fake profiles using machine learning
Processes and analyzes structured user data
Visualizes training accuracy and evaluation results

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
scikit-learn
TensorFlow / Keras

📈 Results
Achieved high accuracy in binary classification
Model trained using ANN with ReLU and Sigmoid activations
